# Project Example

This is a simple hello_world C/C++ project to show a more real-world example of
Makefile usage. The Makefile is more complex than necessary for the scale of
the project but hopefully it will highlight some good practices.

## Concepts

Combination of many things including wildcard dependencies based on real source files

## Try it out

- Take a look at the Makefile and run ``make print_vars`` to see how variables
  are created.
- Run ``make`` to build the executable.
- Try running it with ``./hello_world``
